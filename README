A freelance project written roughly two years ago. A client wanted a large quantity of Word documents (DOCX format) converted to a specific XML format. This involved parsing the DOCX format and dealing with nasty formatted tables. It's a pretty hackish implementation but it worked rather well! Made extensive use of the apache poi xwpf library.
